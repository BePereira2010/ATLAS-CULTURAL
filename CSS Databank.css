/* CSS is an acronym for "Cascading Style Sheets". CSS is used to give HTML documents style and flair.*/
/* CSS operates closely with HTML, not independently.*/
/* There are three main ways through which one may apply CSS to their HTML Document:*/

/* 1- Inline Application: When CSS properties are applied directly in another attribute within an HTML document. Although convenient, this can lead to some mess-ups due to a gradual disorganization of the document*/
/* Example: <h1 style = color: [Content]; background color: [Content];></h1>. Although many properties can be applied to one inline application of CSS properties, they must be separated y semicolons.

/* 2- Internal Application: A style sheet written in CSS is built in the "head" segment of your HTML document, serving to define the properties of your document more separately*/
/* Example: <!DOCTYPE: HTML>
            <html lang="en">
            <head>
                <meta charset="UTF-8">
                <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
                <title>IBCDA MVP</title>
                <style>
                    body{
                (in this context, body is the selected element subject to alteration by CSS. Any other broad element can be chosen)
                    {
                (To open the given property, and close it, one must use curly brackets, as demonstrated. Any properties must be applied between the two)
                <style>
            <head>
            <body>
            lorem
            </body>
            </html>

/* External Application and Inter-Document Association: A style sheet is written in a separate text file, however, it remains capable of interacting with an HTML document through a specific code structure which bonds the two together.*/
/* Specific items can be tagged with "ids" (identification tags) for selection within the "styles.css" document*/
/* Example: (Within an HTML document)
            <!DOCTYPE: HTML>
            <html lang="en">
            <head>
                <meta charset="UTF-8">
                <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
                <title>IBCDA MVP</title>
                <link rel="stylesheet" href="/IBCDA project/styles.css>
            (Within a CSS document attached to the HTML document)
            body{
            (once more, curly brackets are employed)}*/

/* This document will be an External Stlye Sheet to the IBCDA MVP*/
body{
background-color:rgb(250,222,110);

}
