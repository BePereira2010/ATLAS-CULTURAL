<!-- The "<img>" brackets allow one to add an image to their HTML file. The "src" (source) attribute is necessary for the file to procure the image.-->
<!-- If the image, or the files, are separated in folders, then "/s" need to be added as a means to select the folders, to then find the image, as demonstrated.-->
<!--There are "width" and "height" attributes for assigned images, they are measured in pixels, and should one be present, they will proportionally measure themselves out.-->
<!-- The "alt" attribute allows alternative text (for people with visual impairments) to perceive an image. It is recommended to use alt for good practice.-->
<!-- The "title" attribute allows any given image to show an excerpt of text when a cursor hovers above it.-->
